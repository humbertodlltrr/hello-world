# hello-world
Welcome to GitHub!

My name is Humberto Della Torre. I like to program with Python, Java and C++. I tend to use "cool beans" instead of "hello world" when testing code. Along my other repositories you will find several exercises chosen for fun to practice and improve my code. I speak english, hablo español, parlo italiano, j'étudie le français.
